I occasionally dabble with game development but my skill with pixel art is severely lacking so I rely a lot on some great free resources such as [Kenny](https://www.kenney.nl/){:target="\_blank"} and [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/){:target="\_blank"}. Take a look at some of the more or less finished examples below.

<div class="card-deck">
  <div class="card bg-light mb-3">
    <img src="/assets/projects/adventure.png" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Valentine's Adventure</h5>
      <p class="card-text">I thought this would be a fun way of learning some JavaScript and it was, but I probably spent about 10% of the time writing code and the rest doing pixel art.</p>
      <p class="card-text">I used <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> as the framework, while I don't have much experience with other frameworks I thought it was pretty great as a piece of free software.</p>
      <p class="card-text">I also used <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel</a> for creating sprites and other assets and <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org">Tiled</a> for creating tile maps, both of which I would recommend.</p>
      <p class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">WARNING: I made this as a Valentine's day present for my partner so it's a bit soppy. (Play at your own risk)</p>
      <a href="/AdventureGame/index.html" class="btn btn-primary text-white">Play</a>

      <small class="text-muted">In maintenance phase</small>
