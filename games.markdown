I occasionally dabble with game development but my skill with pixel art is severely lacking so I rely a lot on some great free resources such as [Kenny](https://www.kenney.nl/){:target="\_blank"} and [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/){:target="\_blank"}. Take a look at some of the more or less finished examples below.

I thought this would be a fun way of learning some JavaScript and it was, but I probably spent about 10% of the time writing code and the rest doing pixel art.

I used [Phaser](https://phaser.io/){:target="\_blank"} as the framework, while I don't have much experience with other frameworks I thought it was pretty great as a piece of free software.

I also used [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/){:target="\_blank"} for creating sprites and other assets and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/){:target="\_blank"} for creating tile maps, both of which I would recommend.

WARNING: I made this as a Valentine's day present for my partner so it's a bit soppy. (Play at your own risk)

Give the game a go [here]({% link /AdventureGame/index.html %}).
