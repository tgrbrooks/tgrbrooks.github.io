Hi! I'm Tom and this is my website.

I'm a soon to be finished PhD student at the University of Sheffield (hence why I'm procrastinating and building a website) working on simulations of neutrino interactions in liquid argon time projection chambers.

I wanted a website as a centralised place to store things that interest me and might interest others and to hopefully avoid ever having to use LinkedIn when looking for jobs.

So if you are a prospective employer, head over to the [CV]({% link cv.markdown %}) page for an up to date overview of my experience and skills.

For anyone else who's managed to find themself here feel free to browse the [projects]({% link projects.markdown %}) or [games]({% link games.markdown %}) pages for information on some of the things I've been working on in my spare time. You could also head over to my personal [wiki]({% link wiki/wiki.html %}) for a collection of tips and tricks I've accumulated from working with various hardware and software over time.
