As a typical Brit, I'm not a huge fan of singing my own praise and so writing a CV is always a pain. I thought that a fun way of encouraging myself to keep my CV updated would be to make it a bit more interactive so I could write things about myself but pretend I'm just coding.

This was the result, the timeline animations are handled by anime.js and the skill tree uses a modified version of [this](https://github.com/vasturiano/sunburst-chart) sunburst visualisation package which in turn is built on the D3.js library.
