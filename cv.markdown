Download my standard PDF CV [here]({% link assets/CV2_TomBrooks.pdf %}).

...or you can scroll down for a much more fun interactive CV!

If I look like a good fit for your company, why not request a cover letter from my helpful [robot assistant]({% link cover.markdown %}).

I thought that a fun way of encouraging myself to keep my CV updated would be to make it a bit more interactive so I could write things about myself but pretend I'm just coding.

This was the result, the timeline animations are handled by anime.js and the skill tree uses a modified version of [this](https://github.com/vasturiano/sunburst-chart) sunburst visualisation package which in turn is built on the D3.js library.
